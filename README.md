# hello-world
First repository on GitHuB

My name is Herman, I studied visual communication and graphic design in school but found interest in web development in a web design module. Since then, I have been studing web development on and off and am now transitioning to become a web developer. One of my hopes is to merge my graphic/web design knowledge with web development skills and work for a design company that does their own code!
